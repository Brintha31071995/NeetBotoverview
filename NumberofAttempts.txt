Number of Neet Attempts:

With amendments in 2018 for NEET UG eligibility criteria, the restrictions on the number of attempts for NEET was removed. Therefore there is no restriction on the number of attempts for NEET 2024. So, as per the NEET 2024 eligibility criteria, candidates will be allowed to appear for the entrance exam as many times as they would like to only if they are eligible.
